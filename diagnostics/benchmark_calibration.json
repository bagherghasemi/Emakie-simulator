Ecommerce daily revenue is not white noise; ad-spend pacing creates multi-day persistence. Deloitte Retail Volatility Index research shows ecommerce has lower volatility than physical retail, implying higher autocorrelation.",
      "reasoning": "DTC brands on Meta have ad-spend driven revenue. Daily spend is relatively stable within a campaign flight (budget pacing), creating persistence. Weekly cycles (Mon-Tue peaks, weekend troughs) add structure. Lag-1 autocorrelation of 0.35-0.80 captures the range from volatile early-stage brands (lower) to mature scaled brands (higher).

Typical ecommerce CV for weekly revenue is 20-35% (Deloitte, T-shirt company example). For individual order values, the spread is wider due to product mix.",
      "reasoning": "DTC brands selling physical products typically have a range of products at different price points, plus quantity variation. CV of 0.35-1.0 captures brands from narrow catalog (lower CV, e.g., single-product brand) to diverse catalogs with accessories and bundles (higher CV).

      "reasoning": "Purchase intervals in DTC are strongly right-skewed (lognormal-like). Most repeat purchases happen quickly (within 30 days), but a long tail extends to months. This is driven by consumable repurchase cycles (short intervals) mixed with occasional buyers (long intervals). A lognormality p-value of 0.25-0.90 indicates the distribution should pass or nearly pass a lognormality test. Below 0.01 means the distribution is distinctly non-lognormal, which would be unusual."

      "reasoning": "Refund timing is front-loaded: customers discover issues quickly (wrong size, damage, not-as-expected). For physical DTC products, most refunds initiate within 7-14 days of delivery (which itself is 3-7 days after purchase). 25-65% of refunds within 7 days of purchase accounts for variation between fast-fulfillment brands (more 7-day refunds) and slow-shipping brands (refunds delayed by delivery time).

      "reasoning": "Creative fatigue is well-documented and a core simulator mechanism. The negative correlation between age and performance should be moderate to strong (-0.65 to -0.15). The lower bound (-0.65) allows for brands that refresh slowly (strong decay), while -0.15 allows for brands with diverse creative rotation that slows fatigue.

The calibrated range reflects that most DTC brands either maintain relatively stable trust (well-run) or see mild erosion (promise-experience gap). Strong positive trend (>0.3) would require extraordinary improvement in operations. Strong negative trend (<-0.4) would indicate rapid brand destruction. Low confidence because this is simulator-specific."

DTC retention curves show logarithmic decay: steep initial drop-off then gradual stabilization at 15-25% annual retention.",
      "reasoning": "1yr vs 3yr LTV divergence measures how much additional value long-term retention adds. For brands with strong repeat (consumables), 3yr LTV can be 1.5-2.5x of 1yr LTV. For durable goods with low repeat, the divergence is smaller (1.1-1.4x). The range 0.3-1.8 as a ratio of additional value captures this spread. Below 0.05 means 3yr and 1yr LTV are virtually identical (no retention). Above 5.0 means 3yr is 6x of 1yr which implies unrealistically high repeat rates."

      "reasoning": "This tests whether the simulator correctly implements the causal chain: refund -> trust reduction. If the simulator is working correctly, Granger causality should be significant (low p-value). The range 0.001-0.08 expects significance at conventional levels.
